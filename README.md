# RB3DP
RigTig's Big 3D Printer (RB3DP) is a machine for placing material in 3 dimensions. The effector (printing head) hangs from three strings. The length of each string is adjusted by a small stepper motor, so the effector moves in 3D space.

Many types of effectors are possible. Several have been tried with limited success. This project is about getting useful effectors in the scale of metres rather than millimetres as well as refining the 3D positioning of a string-based 3D printer.

For an initial use case, see https://hackaday.io/project/13442-3d-print-emergency-accommodation where locally sourced dirt is the primary material, plus a binder placed using RB3DP. The effector simply dribbles the diluted binder into the dirt to solidify dirt into walls and roof.

# Key features

Print volume is big: 1 to 100+ cubic metres.

Cost is small: less than US$100.

Minimum movement of effector is currently set at 2mm.

Complete printer can be transported by one person in a backback or bucket.


# Big
The RB3DP can print bigger objects than most other 3D printers. One unusual characteristic is that the print base is triangular. The test prototype was somewhat less than a cubic metre. The second installation was about 5 cubic metres. The design is flexible about the size; it just needs enough string. Not yet tested, but 10 to 20 metres in each direction seems workable and probably even more. Each installation does need to be measured to calibrate the printer.

# Inexpensive
The basic RB3DP without an effector costs about $20 (USD) in electronic parts. The knobby string is about $20 for a 100 metre roll, so the cost depends on how big you want to make the RB3DP. The rest of the components are either 3D printed or are scrounged locally to the build area. For example, you need a wall, fence, tree or post to put each motor at the same height above the ground as the other 2 motors. 

# Accuracy
In 10 metres, 2mm is 0.02%, which is more than adequate for buildings.

# Small and portable
The first version fitted in a bucket, including the cabling. The latest version uses its own wifi network, so all the parts fit into a 2 litre food container. Even if you add 3 collapsible tent poles, strings and tent pegs, the whole thing is not too onerous to carry. You still need a netbook or laptop to interact with the printer, but future implementations can do without a computer interface.
